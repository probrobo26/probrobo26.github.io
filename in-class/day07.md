## Going Further

## Day Activity
Today's day activity is designed to provide time on the [simulation assignment](https://canvas.olin.edu/courses/1002/assignments/18433) which aims to complement the mathematical discussions in class with practical implementation.

### Problem 1: Recap of Today's Notes
Go back through today's written notes on this page and work through each of the exercises / be sure to document your answers to the exercises discussed in class (there should be a total of 2 exercises in today's notes).

### Work On The Simulation Assignment
Nothing to turn in for day-activity work here; just get started with the simulation assignment!
